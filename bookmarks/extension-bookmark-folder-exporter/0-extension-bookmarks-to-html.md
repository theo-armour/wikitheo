# Extension Bookmarks to HTML Agenda

## Agenda


## Remember

* If there is a folder with the existing name in Raindrop, the imported file With that name  will go directly to that folder.
* For raindrop.ioNeeds converting to CSV files: Add all the parent folder names as tags to each bookmark.

Create a bookmarklet that extracts all the folders and files in a user-selected folder displayed on my browser's Favorites bar and export them into a standard favorite HTML file.

### Extensions Agenda

Extensions, not bookmarklets (as I had initially thought)) are the way to go for extracting data from Netflix HTML favorites files.

Gemini created an extension and helped me load it effortlessly!

In conjunction with the Favorites Manager in the Browser, I can delete files and use the extension to export files.

I can probably also update the extension to include folder names as tags.

This is a much better solution than bookmarklets for this task.
