My new idea. We would like to put an article, or bookmark, or paper in multiple categories the way we can on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, Raindrop.io only allows a link or article to be in one collection. Otherwise, it is duplicated. This may change in the future, but for now, it is not possible to have one article in multiple categories without duplication.

In some ways, we would like to do this with tags. Unfortunately, tagging does not allow nesting of tags or subcategories of folders.Therefore, you are kind of limited in the number of available tags that can be handled usefully by a human being.Scrolling through a list of a thousand tags does not easily allow you to identify groups of tagsTo organize them, or manage them.

My new idea is that whatever structure you use for collections you should also use for tagging. So an article or link may be placed in its primary category: collection or page folder. At the same time, the tags could be used to allow that article to also appear when you look for a tag with the same reference.

In other words, there may be a tag in architecture in 2 culture, but then there may be a similar or the same article that, because of some aspect, might reference architecture in 13 technology And that article might be tagged with culture, and also with visual arts, and with architecture.

Raindrop's tag system sucks! Only flat tags cannot nest them.Anything over two or three hundred tags is kind of useless.There's no tag cloud! element or interactive tag graph.

Looked a bit at Pinboard. Which I used until 2018. My data is still there.It's all about flat tags! no easy tag hierarchy.

The search capability in Raindrop is really fast!I should be able to make my own tag system. zz item1 zz item 2 zz item3 ~ and use search to find them.

There could even be a second system. xx 1 xx 2 xx 3.

Bookmarks in raindrop are really lumpy! I need to find a way and spend some time cleaning them up. Too many categories with only one or two items in them.

How to use Raindrop tags more effectively?

Want tags for

* people: ace, family
* projects: heritage, events
* topics, areas, types, priorities, statuses.

Reduce the number of collections.

Begin to flatten the collections into years. Start by adding years to collections that are too big to scan easily

* Improving Bookmark Analyzer HTML Tool

The process went extremely well! I really liked the idea that I just chat with it in a very open, unstructured way, and try to let it do as much by itself. I correct or tweak because it keeps finding things that I hadn't thought of.

The notion of bringing all these bookmarks over to some kind of wiki-theo probably does not make sense.

A better idea might be to section by section bring things over to the Wikitheo.

Perhaps start with something like "people" and bring all the people that I have over to Wikitheo.

Then, perhaps, bring over "projects" or "topics" or "areas".

And then always keep the original file for new and different kinds of massaging.Use it as a playground for experimentation.


## Bookmarks

Saving bookmarks to GitHub as Markdown files is probably out of the question.Transporting thousands of files around GitHub takes too long.

So, I do like the idea of Markdown files so that I can use Beyond Compare and other tools to move things back and forth, but there should be a temporary solution.Done locally. So the idea would be that data is kept in a JSON file, and as and when needed, converted to Markdown.After the triage is completed, the file is turned back from Markdown into JSON.
