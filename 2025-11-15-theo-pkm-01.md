# Personal Knowledge Base Categories

This personal knowledge management system adapts Wikipedia's comprehensive 13-category organizational structure for managing digital bookmarks, files, research papers, and personal resources. The system uses a three-level hierarchy (main categories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories) to provide both broad classification and granular organization, making it easy to store, find, and maintain your growing collection of digital knowledge across all domains of life and work.

**Why this system works:** Wikipedia's category structure has been refined over two decades to organize humanity's knowledge effectively. By adapting it for personal use, you gain a battle-tested framework that scales with your needs, prevents duplicate filing, and creates logical pathways to rediscover information. Whether you're managing academic research, professional development resources, creative projects, or personal interests, this system provides consistent organization across all knowledge domains.

- Secondary tags: `#evidence-based`, `#anecdotal`, `#personal-experiment`, `#daily-practice`, `#weekly-review`, `#annual-reflection`, `#private`, `#shareable`, `#actionable`, `#reflective`, `#habit-formation`, `#goal-setting`, `#quantified-self`, `#crisis-resource`

**Organizational Tips:**

- **Separate aspirational from operational**: Create distinct folders for "Active Systems" (current productivity method, habit tracker) and "Exploration" (new frameworks you're considering). Limit active systems to 1 per life area maximum.
- **Prioritize privacy and backup**: Health data, therapy notes, and personal reflections are sensitive—ensure encryption if cloud-stored. Consider local-only storage or encrypted vaults. Backup regularly to multiple locations.
- **Create temporal review structures**: Organize by review frequency—daily notes, weekly reflections, monthly reviews, quarterly assessments, annual retrospectives. Use ISO date formats (YYYY-MM-DD) for chronological sorting.
- **Label evergreen vs. experiments**: Use `[SYSTEM]` for ongoing practices vs. `[EXPERIMENT - Start: 2025-01]` for trials. Review experiments monthly; promote to systems, modify, or delete.
- **Avoid pseudo-productivity hoarding**: Rule: For every new productivity system saved, delete an old unused one. Keep a "Tried and Abandoned" log with notes on why systems didn't work.
- **Link to real outcomes**: Cross-reference personal development resources with actual results. Create a "What Actually Worked for Me" master document to prevent re-learning hard lessons.

- Secondary tags: `#argument-mapping`, `#cognitive-development`, `#philosophical-methods`, `#moral-philosophy`, `#mind-philosophy`, `#fallacies`, `#thought-experiments`, `#philosophical-tradition`

**Organizational Tips:**

- **Distinguish discipline from tools**: Save academic philosophical content (papers on Kant, metaphysics) separately from practical thinking tools (logic apps, argument mapping). Consider sub-folders: "Academic Philosophy" and "Thinking Skills Development."
- **Use thinker-based and topic-based naming**: For texts, include philosopher's name (e.g., "Rawls_Justice-as-Fairness_1985.pdf"). For tools, lead with skill (e.g., "Logic_Brilliant-Course_Propositional-Logic").
- **Review quarterly with learning log**: Philosophy benefits from revisiting. Every 3 months, review articles and add notes on how your understanding evolved, creating a personal intellectual timeline.
- **Cross-reference with Society**: Political philosophy overlaps with political science; philosophy of mind connects to psychology. Use `#crossref-society` for bridging resources.
- **Avoid overloading introductory material**: Choose 2-3 comprehensive introductory resources and focus on building depth in areas of genuine interest. Archive completed materials after mastery.
- **Create "Practical Application" section**: Save resources showing how philosophical concepts apply to daily life, decision-making, and professional contexts.

- Secondary tags: `#digital-religion`, `#interfaith-dialogue`, `#religious-history`, `#meditation-mindfulness`, `#secular-spirituality`, `#tradition-specific`, `#religious-ethics`, `#mysticism`

**Organizational Tips:**

- **Separate academic from personal**: Create distinct folders for scholarly articles about religion (objective study) versus resources for spiritual practice (subjective engagement). This prevents conflation of learning *about* religion with resources *for* practice.
- **Tradition-specific organization**: Create sub-folders by major traditions (Abrahamic, Dharmic, Indigenous, Secular) with further subdivision by specific religions. Use tags to connect themes across traditions.
- **Date-stamp time-sensitive content**: Holiday guides, liturgical calendars, and contemporary commentary become dated. Include year in filename and review annually.
- **Cross-reference broadly**: Use `#crossref-philosophy` for theological philosophy and `#crossref-society` for religion's role in politics, culture, and social movements.
- **Note source credibility**: Religious content ranges from scholarly to devotional to polemical. Tag source type: `#academic`, `#devotional`, `#apologetic`, `#interfaith`, or `#critical-study`.
- **Create "Contemporary Issues" folder**: Dedicate space for resources on how faith traditions respond to modern challenges like AI, bioethics, and climate change.

- Secondary tags: `#quantitative-research`, `#qualitative-research`, `#behavioral-science`, `#political-science`, `#anthropology`, `#economics`, `#demographics`, `#social-issues`

**Organizational Tips:**

- **Organize by methodology AND topic**: Create dual-folder system—one by research method (quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods) and another by topic (education, inequality, political behavior). Use tags to connect both dimensions.
- **Maintain "Methods Toolkit"**: Keep all statistical software tutorials, research design templates, and data analysis guides in one accessible location separate from content research. Include version numbers.
- **Use project-based organization**: For active research, create project-specific folders with standardized structure: Literature, Data, Analysis, Writing. Archive completed projects annually.
- **Tag by recency**: Use tags like `#2025`, `#recent-5yrs`, `#seminal-work` to distinguish currency. Review annually and re-tag older materials. Pre-pandemic research may need `#pre-covid` context.
- **Cross-reference extensively**: Social sciences overlap broadly—tag connections to Technology for computational social science, to Philosophy for theoretical foundations, to Religion for sociology of religion.
- **Separate popular from academic**: Create clear distinction between peer-reviewed research and popular science articles. Both are valuable but serve different purposes.

**Organizational Tips:**

- **Separate learning from reference**: Create distinct folders for "Learning" (tutorials, courses, explanations) versus "Reference" (API docs, command references, troubleshooting). Learning is consumed sequentially; reference is consulted as-needed.
- **Version control is critical**: Include version numbers and dates in filenames (e.g., "TensorFlow-2.15-Tutorial_2025.pdf"). Review quarterly and archive superseded versions. Mark evergreen content with `#fundamentals`.
- **Maintain "Current Stack" folder**: Keep documentation for technologies you're actively using separate from exploratory/future interests. Include sub-folders by tool category: Programming Languages, Cloud Services, Data Tools.
- **Tag by application domain**: Use secondary tags for what you're building: `#scientific-research`, `#web-development`, `#data-visualization`, `#automation-workflow`. Technology is a means; tag by ends.
- **Create "Staying Current" system**: Bookmark 3-5 key news sources and schedule monthly review sessions. Don't save every article—maintain a "Tech Trends 2025" document summarizing key developments quarterly.
- **Cross-reference all categories**: AI impacts all domains; computational methods connect to social sciences; digital tools enhance your entire knowledge base. Use `#tool-for-KM` for technologies enhancing your personal knowledge base.
- **Distinguish hype from substance**: Add context tags: `#speculation`, `#early-stage`, `#proven-tech`, `#research-stage`. Maintain healthy skepticism and focus on actionable, tested solutions.

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Base

**Step 1: Choose Your Platform**
Select a knowledge management tool that supports:

- Hierarchical folder structures or nested tags
- Full-text search across all content
- Markdown formatting (for GitHub Pages compatibility)
- Export capabilities for backup
- Cross-linking between items

Recommended platforms: Obsidian (local-first, free), Notion (cloud-based, freemium), Logseq (open-source), Zotero (for academic papers), or simple folder structure with Markdown files for GitHub Pages.

**Step 2: Create Your Category Structure**
Set up all 13 main categories as top-level folders or tags. Within each, create 2-3 levels of subcategories based on your actual content needs. Start minimal and expand as your collection grows.

**Step 3: Establish Naming Conventions**
Develop consistent file naming patterns:

- **Format**: `Category_Subcategory_SourceName_Descriptor_Date.extension`
- **Example**: `Tech_AI_Stanford_AIIndex2025_2025-03.pdf`
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for chronological sorting
- Include version numbers for technical documentation
- Keep filenames under 60 characters when possible

**Step 4: Implement Tagging System**
Create a master tag list starting with the primary and secondary tags listed in each category. Add custom tags as needed but maintain discipline—too many unique tags reduce findability.

**Step 5: Set Up Backup System**

- **Daily**: Automated sync to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- **Weekly**: Local backup to external drive
- **Monthly**: Export full database to portable format
- **Quarterly**: Archive old exports to long-term storage

**Step 6: Schedule Review Sessions**

- **Weekly**: Process new items (5-10 minutes)
- **Monthly**: Review active project folders and productivity resources (30 minutes)
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive category review, remove dead links, update tags (2 hours)
- **Annually**: Complete system audit and reorganization (half day)

### Maintaining Your Knowledge Base

**Intake Process for New Items:**

1. Capture immediately to inbox/unsorted folder
2. Weekly processing: Review inbox, assign category, add tags, rename file
3. Add brief annotation: why saved, how useful, when to revisit
4. Create links to related items in other categories
5. Update master index or table of contents

**Preventing Information Overload:**

- Apply the "one in, one out" rule for aspirational content
- Limit active learning resources to 3-5 per category
- Archive completed courses, finished projects, and outdated resources
- Delete rather than archive if you haven't accessed content in 2+ years
- Focus on resources you'll actually use, not comprehensive collection

**Quality Over Quantity:**

- Prioritize depth in areas of active interest over breadth across all topics
- Save the single best resource for each specific need
- Regularly identify and remove duplicate or redundant resources
- Maintain a "Top Resources" document for each main category
- Create synthesis documents that combine insights from multiple sources

**Cross-Category Management:**
When resources span multiple categories:

- File in the primary category (where you'll look first)
- Use tags to indicate all relevant categories
- Create index notes that link related content across categories
- Use your PKM tool's linking features to create connections
- Maintain a "Connections" document mapping interdisciplinary resources

### GitHub Pages Deployment

**Repository Structure:**

```
knowledge-base/
├── README.md (this document)
├── index.md (homepage with TOC)
├── _config.yml (Jekyll configuration)
├── categories/
│   ├── 01-general-reference.md
│   ├── 02-culture-and-arts.md
│   ├── 03-geography-and-places.md
│   └── ... (all 13 categories)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   └── images/
└── bookmarks/
    └── (organized bookmark exports)
```

**Jekyll Configuration (_config.yml):**

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
title: Personal Knowledge Base
description: Wikipedia-inspired organization system
markdown: kramdown
```

**Homepage (index.md):**
Create a landing page with the table of contents, system overview, and quick links to all 13 categories. Include search functionality if using Jekyll theme with search support.

**Category Pages:**
Each category gets its own markdown file with:

- Category description
- Subcategory navigation
- Recent additions section
- Most-used resources list
- Tags specific to that category

**Automation:**
Set up GitHub Actions to:

- Automatically rebuild site on push
- Validate markdown formatting
- Check for broken links
- Update "last modified" dates

### Best Practices Summary

**Do:**

- Review and update regularly on schedule
- Use consistent naming and tagging
- Back up frequently to multiple locations
- Start minimal and expand organically
- Link related resources across categories
- Document why you saved each resource
- Maintain privacy for sensitive personal content

**Don't:**

- Save everything "just in case"
- Create overly complex nested structures
- Neglect regular maintenance
- Duplicate resources across multiple locations
- Use unclear or inconsistent naming
- Forget to remove outdated or dead links
- Let your inbox/unsorted folder grow unbounded

**Remember:** The goal is a working system that helps you find and use information, not a perfect archive of all possible knowledge. Optimize for retrieval and utility, not comprehensiveness.
